This program reads the frequency of letters from frequency.txt, builds a huffman tree, reads an input string 
from input.txt, writes the encoded message to encoded.txt, and finally decodes the message and writes it to 
decoded.txt.

This project was completed for my data structures course in Spring 2019.
